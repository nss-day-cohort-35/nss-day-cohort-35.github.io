# Welcome to the Nashville Software School's Cohort 35 Website

*View at https://nss-day-cohort-35.github.io/*

## Project Overview
Each cohort at NSS has a class website for potential employers to view student accomplishments prior to Demo Day. As the UX/UI half of Cohort 35 we used our class website as a protype to showcase our abilities in the design and implemenation process of user design. We bypassed the cookie cutter template that past cohorts have used and started from scratch by:

+ defining our user
+ understanding their pain points
+ creating a new website layout
+ condensing copy and information
+ observing user testing

## Challenge Statement
How might we promote Demo Day and showcase Cohort 35â€™s dual skill sets to potential employers with the ultimate goal of employment?

## Wireframes and Mockups

Individually, we researched color palettes on websites such as: 

+ https://coolors.co/
+ https://color.adobe.com/create
+ http://colormind.io/

Then the UI/UX class narrowed down our options to 2 color palettes. We felt the colors in the palettes we chose were both muted and modern. We then sent the 2 palettes choices in a poll to the full stack side of the cohort to vote on. Once the votes were in we used the agreed apon colors for the website.

We used Figma to prototype the Website:

## User Testing
For our research we interviewed our career services and placement team here at Nashville Software School.

We also connected with local external graphic designers and senior web developers in the industry for informal feed back before finalizing our project.

## Lessons Learned

+ Observing user testing through out the creation of a project can help keep focus on areas that are important to the end user.
+ Refering to the defined user can help guide decision making.
